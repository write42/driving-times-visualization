Out of all times during the pregnancy, no matter if the nearest clinic is open or closed, Texas has the longest drive times overall. There is a consistent gap between Texas and the times of other states. The main exception is when the pregnancy is sixteen weeks along and the nearest clinic is closed. Utah is a close second at one hundred and thirty-eight minutes with the next state, Oregon, coming in at sixty-nine minutes.
