Out of all times during the pregnancy, no matter if the nearest clinic is open or closed, Texas has the longest drive times overall. There is a consistent gap between Texas and the times of other states. The main exception is when the pregnancy is at sixteen weeks and the nearest clinic is closed. Utah is a close second at one hundred and thirty-eight minutes with the next state, Oregon, coming in at sixty-nine minutes.

The original article states that Texas had the number of their clinics cut in half, which would explain the larger drive times in comparison to other states.

While the article was written in 2017, the results from this data may not hold true in the present.
