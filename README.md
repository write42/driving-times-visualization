  The states that the article linked in the source of data looks at specifically are North Dakota, Louisiana, Arkansas, Utah, and Oklahoma.
North Dakota has the third most abortions at eight weeks when the closest clinic is closed at 26. At the same time, Texas has 125.


Looking at these specific states that the article looks upon that have the closest clinics closed at differing times during the pregnancy

Out of all times during the pregnancy, no matter if the nearest clinic is open or closed, Texas has the longest drive times overall. There is a consistent gap between Texas and the times of other states. The main exception is when the pregnancy is sixteen weeks along and the nearest clinic is closed. Utah is a close second at one hundred and thirty-eight minutes with the next state, Oregon, coming in at sixty-nine minutes.
